Testing testing, things just got, interesting

You may wonder why what's never been's never been so, hell, were nowhere now

Right, this is a proper entry, I guess. This is a test, respond if you are able. 

I guess, since my last PC just got fixed and I have a few log entries there, it is fitting that I make a new log, with new log entries. But jesus christ, I have entries there that go back to 2018, that's so damn long ago I don't even remember shit anymore.

Well, I remember, I remember Julia, and how cute she was and how happy she made me.

I remember Hugh, that little son of a bitch.

But I guess, what I remember the most is my naivete, how optimistic and hopeful I was, all now replaced by nothing but suffering and disdain for life.

I do not quite understand what's wrong with me, maybe adulthood got me, maybe it did not, but I just want to rest, have a good night's sleep, and eat with my heart's content. Maybe that's it, maybe it isn't.

But I'm alive, I guess, and as long as I am, my heart will keep pounding.

I wish to read my old entries from that old log, I wish to see what changed, I guess my last entry there was on 2021, and a lot has changed indeed. I got to UPD, BS Physics, I got into a fraternity, I became a high ranking member of UP AstroSoc, and I got a... I loved someone. Really loved someone, and she broke my heart
My mother died, too. It was... painful, I guess, but nothing we can do, huh.

Well, it is what it is, I'll see you when I see you, log.

New entry, log, another testing

Perhaps, one should record himself stifling in matters at hand, my true thoughts are in discord.

Navi, I love you, and you told me you loved me, but why did you leave me and betray me by being such a fucking bitch. And now you're talking to me like nothing ever happened. Are you for real, are you really this dense?

However, I can't blame myself, for I am what I am, and I do not know when to quit

I never gave up on you. I hope you know that

But it's getting easier and easier. 


2024-11-22 02:41:34

You are my greatest love and my worst heartbreak.

After I trusted you with all my love, you leave me alone in the gutter like some piece of shit

Why did you do that


2024-11-22 02:43:23

This is an endles night of testing, baby
 
Hell yeah
 

2024-11-22 02:45:09

Yknow, for the longest time, I wanted to quit smoking. Maybe I should. 
 
Navi wanted to make me quit smoking, and frankly I'm just too stupid to do it
 
But, yeah, I guess. 
 
I miss her, so much. But she broke me.


2024-11-22 02:45:42

More testing, how art thee


2024-11-22 02:46:29

Perhaps, I would die.
 
Maybe, but not today.
